Food Calculator: Break down what everybody should pay on a group order


v1.00 (01/11/24)
First iteration of my food calculator. Input validation to ensure no negative
values can be entered as well as a menu system to navigate the program. 

Will update with more efficient / streamlined code as I learn more.
